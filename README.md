# NumpyArrayInterface.jl

Defines a Julia analogue of the [Numpy array interface](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.interface.html).

By default this includes all strided arrays whose elements are of bits types.

You can test whether an object defines the interface, and query it for information such as the size of the buffer and a pointer to the data.

## Install

pkg> add NumpyArrayInterface
